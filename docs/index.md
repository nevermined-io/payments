# Nevermined Payments Library

## Introduction

The Nevermined Payments Libraries are software components that empower AI Builders to create, integrate, and monetize AI applications.

These libraries enable AI Builders to monetize their AI Applications (such as AI Agents or Services), integrate external AI applications, and interact with them in a standardized way.

The Payment Libraries are designed for two main scenarios:
1. **Human to Agent**: The libraries can be used in browser or CLI environments, allowing human users to interact with AI Agents. They support registering and listing AI Agents, purchasing access, and querying agents as subscribers.
2. **Agent to Agent**: The libraries can be embedded within AI Agents, enabling them to interact with other AI Agents, purchase access to APIs, and query them programmatically.

Nevermined Payment Libraries excel at enabling seamless interactions between AI Agents.

The libraries are available in [Python](https://github.com/nevermined-io/payments-py) and
[TypeScript](https://github.com/nevermined-io/payments).

Both implementations provide the same API. The Python version is ideal for AI Builders, Data Scientists, and Data Engineers.

The TypeScript implementation is well-suited for building AI Agents/Services and integrating with frontend applications.

## Main Features

- Register AI Agents and the APIs they expose
- Register Payment Plans
- Associate AI Agents with Payment Plans
- Order Pricing Plans to access AI Agents, files, and more
- Query AI Agents programmatically
